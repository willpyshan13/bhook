      description: |
        Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is.

        If relevant, add a minimal example so that we can reproduce the error by running the code. It is very important for the code snippet to be as succinct (minimal) as possible, so please take time to trim down any irrelevant code to help us debug efficiently. We are going to copy-paste your code and we expect to get the same result as you did.

        If you observe an error, please paste the **full** error message you got. In case of a native crash, please paste the **full** tombstone in the `/data/tombstones` directory. For non-rooted devices, refer to [bugreport](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/bug-report).
